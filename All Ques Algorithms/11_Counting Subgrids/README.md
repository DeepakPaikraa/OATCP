Problem Definition:

Given an n x n grid of integers, find the number of subgrids (rectangular subsets) where all four corners contain 1.

Approach:

Identify Rows with Common Ones:

The algorithm counts the pairs of rows (a, b) where there is at least one common 1 in the same column.
To do this, it uses a nested loop. The outer loop iterates over each row a, and the inner loop iterates over subsequent rows b (where b > a).

Count Common Columns with Ones:

For each pair of rows a and b, the algorithm counts the number of common columns where both color[a][i] == 1 and color[b][i] == 1.
If the common columns are count, then the possible rectangles (subgrids) formed with these corners can be calculated.
Calculate Rectangles (Subgrids) for Each Pair of Rows:
The number of subgrids formed by count common columns is given by the combination formula for choosing 2 out of count, which is (count - 1) * count / 2.
The formula represents the possible pairings of common columns between rows a and b. Each pairing represents a valid subgrid with all corners containing 1.

Accumulate the Total Subgrids:

Initialize subgrids to 0.
For each pair of rows, add the calculated rectangles (subgrids) to subgrids.
This sum represents the total subgrids formed by common corners.

Return the Result:

After all row pairs are processed, return subgrids as the total number of subgrids with common corners containing 1.
Implementation Details:

Nested Loop to Compare Rows:

The outer loop iterates from 0 to n-1, and the inner loop iterates from a + 1 to n-1.

Common Columns Count:

For each pair of rows a and b, count the common columns with 1 using a loop over i from 0 to n-1.

Calculate Rectangles for Row Pairs:

Use the combination formula (count - 1) * count / 2 to get the number of subgrids for each row pair.

Summary:

The algorithm efficiently computes the total number of subgrids (rectangles) with all corners containing 1 by examining pairs of rows for common columns with 1. It uses a nested loop approach to iterate over all row pairs, and the final output represents the accumulated count of subgrids across all possible pairs of rows.
