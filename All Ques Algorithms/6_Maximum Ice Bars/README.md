This algorithm aims to find the maximum number of ice cream bars that can be purchased with a given number of coins.

Problem Definition:

Given a list of costs for ice cream bars and a specific number of coins, determine the maximum number of ice cream bars that can be bought.

Approach:

Greedy Strategy with Sorting:

To maximize the number of ice cream bars purchased, a greedy strategy is used. This involves always buying the cheapest bar available until the remaining coins are not enough to buy the next cheapest.

Sorting the costs array in ascending order helps ensure that we are always choosing the cheapest available bar, allowing us to maximize the count.

Loop Through Costs:

Initialize a counter count to keep track of the number of bars bought.
Loop through the sorted costs array, representing the prices of each ice cream bar.
If the current cost is affordable (i.e., coins >= cost), reduce coins by the current cost, and increment count. This action represents the decision to buy that bar.
If the current cost is not affordable, break the loop, indicating that further bars are out of budget.

Return the Total Count:

Once the loop completes, the total count of bars purchased is returned. This count represents the maximum number of ice cream bars that can be bought with the given coins.

Input/Output Handling:

The program reads input from a file input3.txt, which contains the number of bars n, the costs of the bars, and the total amount of coins available.
After processing, it writes the result to a file output3.txt.
Implementation Details:
Sorting the Costs Array:
The costs array is sorted using std::sort in ascending order.

Main Loop:

The loop iterates through the sorted costs array. If the current bar's cost is less than or equal to the available coins, it is bought, the count is incremented, and coins are reduced. If not, the loop breaks.

Output:

After calculating the maximum number of ice cream bars, the program outputs the result with appropriate text.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, and the subsequent loop for purchasing has a linear complexity of O(n). The greedy strategy ensures that the most cost-effective approach is taken to maximize the number of ice cream bars purchased.
