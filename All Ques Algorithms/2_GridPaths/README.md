This algorithm is a common solution for the problem of counting paths in a grid while avoiding obstacles.

Problem Definition: Given an N x N grid where some cells contain obstacles (denoted by '*'), calculate the number of ways to reach the bottom-right corner (cell (N-1, N-1)) from the top-left corner (cell (0, 0)). Movement is restricted to rightward or downward directions. 

Dynamic Programming Table: Create a dp table of size N x N to store the number of paths from (0, 0) to any cell (i, j). Initialize the entire table to zero.

Base Cases:

Initialize the first row. If a cell contains an obstacle, no further cells in that row can be reached, so the loop breaks. Otherwise, set dp[0][j] = 1.

Initialize the first column similarly. If a cell contains an obstacle, no further cells in that column can be reached. Otherwise, set dp[i][0] = 1.

Dynamic Programming Transition: For each cell (i, j), starting from (1, 1), determine the number of ways to reach it by summing the paths from the cell above (i-1, j) and the cell to the left (i, j-1), subject to the modulo constraint mod = 1000000007.

If cell (i, j) contains an obstacle, set dp[i][j] = 0.

Otherwise, dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]) % mod.

Return Result: The answer to the problem is the value at dp[N-1][N-1], representing the number of paths from (0, 0) to (N-1, N-1). Return this value as the result.

Input/Output Handling:

The code reads the size N and the N x N grid from an input file input1.txt.

After processing, it writes the result to an output file output1.txt.
Properly manage input/output stream redirection for file-based processing, and restore default streams afterward.

Thus, the key to the solution is setting up a dp table, initializing the base cases, defining the transition function based on valid movements, and computing the number of paths while avoiding obstacles.
