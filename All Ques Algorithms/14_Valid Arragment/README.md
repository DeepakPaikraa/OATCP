Problem Definition:

Given a list of directed pairs representing edges in a graph, find a valid arrangement such that the sequence forms an Eulerian path.

Key Concepts:

Eulerian Path: A path that visits every edge exactly once. It is possible when the graph has exactly one vertex with out-degree = in-degree + 1 (start of the path) and one vertex with in-degree = out-degree + 1 (end of the path), with all other vertices having equal in-degrees and out-degrees.
Depth-First Search (DFS): A traversal method used to create the Eulerian path in the correct order.

Algorithm Outline:

Build the Graph:

Use unordered_map<int, vector<int>> to represent the adjacency list for the directed graph.
Use unordered_map<int, int> to track the in-degrees and out-degrees for each node.
Iterate over the given pairs of edges to build the graph and update the in-degrees and out-degrees.

Find the Starting Point:

The starting point for the Eulerian path should be the node with out-degree = in-degree + 1.
If no such node exists, use the first node with non-zero out-degrees as the starting point.

Depth-First Search (DFS) for Eulerian Path:

Implement a dfs function to traverse the graph in an Eulerian manner.
Recursively visit adjacent nodes while popping the edge from the adjacency list.
Append the current node to the result list v upon completing all adjacent nodes.
This ensures that the path is constructed in reverse order (from end to start).

Construct the Valid Arrangement:

After the dfs traversal, reverse the order of the result list v to get the correct path order.
Use the reversed list to create the edge pairs for the valid arrangement.

Return the Valid Arrangement:

If the size of the result list does not match the expected number of edges, it indicates a problem (no valid arrangement). Otherwise, return the arrangement in the correct order.

Implementation Details:

Graph Construction: The build_graph function constructs the graph and updates the in-degrees and out-degrees.

Finding Start Point: The loop finds the node with out-degree = in-degree + 1 to start the DFS.

DFS Traversal: The recursive DFS ensures that each edge is visited exactly once, building the Eulerian path.

Creating Valid Arrangement: The validArrangement function constructs the result by reversing the traversal order and returning the valid arrangement.
