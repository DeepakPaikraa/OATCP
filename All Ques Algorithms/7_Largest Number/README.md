The main goal of this code is to create the largest possible number by concatenating the given integers.

Problem Definition:
Given a list of integers, return the largest possible number as a concatenated string. This can be achieved by finding the optimal order for concatenation.

Approach:
Convert Integers to Strings:
The first step is to convert all integers into their corresponding string representations. This allows for easy concatenation and comparison.
Custom Comparator for Sorting:
A custom comparator function, compareNums, is defined. This function determines which order of concatenation yields a larger number.
The function takes two strings a and b and returns true if a + b is greater than b + a, indicating that a should come before b in the final sorted order.
Sorting with Custom Comparator:
The array of string representations is sorted using the custom comparator.
This ensures that the concatenation of strings results in the largest possible number.
Handle Edge Case for Leading Zeros:
After sorting, the algorithm checks if the first element is "0". This would indicate that all elements are zero, so the final result should be "0".
If the first element is not "0", continue with concatenation.
Concatenate Sorted Strings:
After sorting, concatenate all strings to form the largest possible number.
This concatenated string is the result, representing the largest number formed by the given integers.
Return the Result:
The final result is returned as a concatenated string representing the largest possible number.
Input/Output Handling:
The code reads the number of elements from an input file input2.txt.
It reads n integers into a vector nums.
The code outputs the result of largestNumber(nums) to an output file output2.txt.
Time Complexity:
The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation, which is O(n log n). Converting integers to strings and concatenating strings has linear complexity O(n), making the sorting step the most computationally expensive operation.
