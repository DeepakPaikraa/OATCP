Problem Definition:
The code reads two arrays, a and b, from an input file input3.txt. It then calculates a count of pairs (a[i], b[j]) where |a[i] - b[j]| <= 1. Once such a pair is found, the element in b[j] is marked as "used" by setting it to a value (-100) that doesn't interfere with future comparisons. The final count of such pairs is the desired output, written to an output file output3.txt.

Algorithm Approach:
Reading Input:
The program reads an integer n, which represents the size of the first array a.
Then, it reads the n elements into the array a.
Similarly, it reads an integer m, which represents the size of the second array b.
It reads the m elements into the array b.
Sorting Arrays:
Both arrays a and b are sorted in ascending order. Sorting helps to find pairs more efficiently because you can iterate over the arrays in a structured manner.
Finding Valid Pairs:
Using a double for loop, the code iterates over all elements in array a and then for each element, iterates over all elements in array b.
If the absolute difference |a[i] - b[j]| is less than or equal to 1, this is considered a valid pair. The code increments the counter ans to keep track of the number of valid pairs.
Once a valid pair is found, the element in b[j] is marked as used by setting it to a value (-100) that will not interfere with further comparisons.
The inner loop breaks after finding a valid pair to avoid double-counting and move on to the next element in a.
Outputting the Result:
After iterating through both arrays, the program outputs the total number of valid pairs (ans) to an output file with a specific format ("Output: <ans>").
Summary:
This algorithm finds pairs of elements between two sorted arrays a and b where the absolute difference between elements is less than or equal to 1. It ensures that elements in b are used at most once by marking them after a successful pairing. This approach uses sorting to facilitate structured iteration, which helps find valid pairs efficiently.
