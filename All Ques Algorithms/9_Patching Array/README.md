Problem Definition:

Given a sorted list of positive integers nums and a target n, find the minimum number of "patches" (numbers to be added to nums) such that the range [1, n] can be represented as the sum of subsets of the extended list nums.

Approach:

Initialization:

Define a variable req (short for required) to track the smallest missing integer in the range [1, n] that cannot be represented by the existing elements in nums. Initialize req to 1.
Set i to 0 to iterate through nums, and ret to 0 to count the number of patches needed.

Main Loop:

Continue looping while req <= n. This means that if you can ensure all numbers up to req, you're getting closer to covering [1, n].
If i < nums.size() and nums[i] <= req, then the current nums[i] can cover req. So add nums[i] to req and move to the next index (i++).
If nums[i] > req or you've reached the end of nums, you need a "patch" to cover req. To cover it, add req to itself (because that's the smallest number that can cover all numbers in [1, req-1]), then increment ret (a new patch is added).

Result:

When req is greater than n, the loop exits, and you have covered all numbers from 1 to n.
The ret variable indicates the total number of patches required to cover [1, n].

Implementation Details:

The algorithm iterates through nums, comparing nums[i] with req.
If nums[i] <= req, it means you can cover req, so update req to req + nums[i].
If nums[i] > req, you need to add a new patch (req itself), which will then cover req, and continue the process until req > n.

Complexity:

The overall complexity is O(size + k), where size is the size of nums, and k is the number of patches added. This approach efficiently ensures the range [1, n] is covered with the minimum number of additional elements (patches).
