Problem Definition:
Given a vector of integers, calculate the total Hamming distance between every pair of integers. The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Approach:
Iterate Over Each Bit Position:
There are 32 possible bit positions for a 32-bit integer.
For each position pos, count the number of ones (1s) and zeros (0s) in that bit position across all elements in the vector v.
Calculate Hamming Distance for Bit Position:
The Hamming distance for a specific bit position is the product of the number of ones and zeros at that position.
This is because every one-zero pair represents a difference at that bit position.
Sum the Hamming Distances:
Accumulate the Hamming distances across all bit positions.
Add the calculated value for each position to the running total ans.
Return the Total Hamming Distance:
The total Hamming distance is the sum of all Hamming distances for each bit position.
This total represents the cumulative number of bit differences across all possible pairs in the vector v.
Implementation Details:
Bit Manipulation: To count ones and zeros at a specific bit position, use bitwise operations. The expression (v[i] >> pos) & 1 checks if the bit at position pos is set (i.e., if it's 1).
Inner Loop: For each bit position pos, count the number of ones and zeros. The inner loop iterates over all elements in v.
Outer Loop: Iterate over all bit positions (0 to 31). For each position, calculate the product of ones and zeros to get the Hamming distance for that position.
Final Result: The variable ans accumulates the total Hamming distance, which is the sum of the products for all bit positions.
Complexity:
The outer loop iterates over 32 bit positions.
The inner loop iterates over all elements in v. Thus, the overall complexity is O(32 * n) = O(n), where n is the size of the vector v.
Summary:
The algorithm calculates the total Hamming distance by counting ones and zeros for each bit position and summing the products of these counts. This efficiently computes the cumulative Hamming distance for every pair of integers in the given vector v.
