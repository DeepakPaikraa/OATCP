
Here's a summary of the algorithm used in the given code snippet, which describes the process of removing k digits from a given number to form the smallest possible number:

Problem Statement:

Given a string num representing a large number and an integer k, find the smallest possible number after removing exactly k digits from num.

Approach:

Corner Case:

If the number of digits in num is equal to k, the smallest number is 0, since all digits would be removed. Handle this case explicitly by outputting "0" and exiting early.

Use a Stack to Maintain Non-decreasing Order:

Create a stack q to store the digits of num.
Loop through each digit in num.
While the stack is not empty, the top of the stack is greater than the current digit, and k > 0 (removals remaining):
Pop the stack's top element (removing larger digits) to create a smaller number.
Decrement k by 1.
Push the current digit onto the stack.

Final Adjustments:

After the loop, there may still be additional digits to remove. Pop from the stack until k reaches zero.
To handle cases of leading zeros, use another stack q1 to reverse the elements of q (to restore correct order), then remove leading zeros from q1.

Form the Resulting Number:

Create a string ans by popping all elements from q1 (which now has digits in correct order with leading zeros removed).
If the stack is empty, ans is empty. If the stack contains one element, it might be '0'. Handle this by ensuring at least one character in ans.

Output the Result:

Print ans, which is the smallest possible number after removing k digits from num.

Summary:

The algorithm uses a greedy approach with a stack to keep a non-decreasing sequence of digits. By removing larger digits when encountering smaller ones (while k > 0), the resulting sequence tends to be smaller. This is equivalent to "cleaning up" the number to create the smallest possible outcome. Handling edge cases like leading zeros and ensuring proper order after stack operations is key to ensuring the correct final result.
