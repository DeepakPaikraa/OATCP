The main function maxRotateFunction calculates the maximum value of the rotation function for an array, which is derived from the concept of rotating the array and computing the function value F(k). Here's the explanation:

Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers nums of size n, define a function F(k), where F(k) = Î£(i * nums[(i + k) % n]) for i = 0 to n - 1. The goal is to find the maximum value among F(0), F(1), ..., F(n - 1).

Approach:
Initial Calculation:
Calculate the sum of all elements in nums to use later in updating F(k).
Calculate F(0), which is the initial "rotation function" value. This is computed by summing i * nums[i] for each index i from 0 to n-1.
Set maxRotation to F(0) to track the maximum rotation function value.
Updating F(k):
From the observation that F(k+1) = F(k) + sum - n * nums[n - k], the algorithm iterates from k = 1 to n-1 to calculate each subsequent F(k) value.
The formula F(k+1) = F(k) + sum - n * nums[n - k] can be derived by noticing how the indices are affected by rotation. Each element in nums is shifted right by one position, except the last element, which becomes the first. This formula allows F(k+1) to be calculated from F(k) in constant time, making the algorithm efficient.
Finding the Maximum Value:
For each iteration, update rotationSum with the new F(k+1) value.
If the updated rotationSum is greater than maxRotation, update maxRotation with the new maximum value.
Return the Maximum:
After all iterations, the maximum value of F(0), F(1), ..., F(n - 1) is stored in maxRotation.
Return maxRotation as the result, cast to an integer for compatibility.
Input/Output Handling:
The program reads the array size n and its elements from an input file input3.txt, calculates the maximum rotation function value using maxRotateFunction(nums), and writes the result to output3.txt.

This algorithm is efficient because it reduces the computation of each new F(k) value to constant time, resulting in an O(n) overall complexity. This approach handles potentially large integers with a long long type to avoid overflow.
