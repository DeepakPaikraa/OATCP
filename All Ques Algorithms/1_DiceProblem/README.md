here is a summary of the algorithm in a more concise form:

Problem: Given an integer n, calculate the number of ways to reach n by rolling a dice with outcomes from 1 to 6. The objective is to compute this efficiently using dynamic programming.

Initialization: A dynamic programming array DP is initialized with zeros and its base case DP[0] = 1, representing one way to get a sum of zero (by not rolling).

Recursion with Memoization: The compute(left) function recursively calculates the number of ways to achieve the value left by considering all dice rolls from 1 to 6. If the result for left is already computed in DP, it is returned directly. Otherwise, the function sums the possible results of rolling outcomes from 1 to 6 recursively, ensuring results remain within a modulus (MOD).

Main Loop: For a given number of test cases t, the main loop takes an input value n and calculates the result using the compute function. If n is less than zero, it outputs "0". Otherwise, it resets DP and calls compute(n), outputting the result modulo MOD.

Output: The result for each test case is written to the output file with proper formatting, considering the specified input and output redirections using freopen.

In essence, this algorithm allows for efficient computation of the dice roll problem with memoization to avoid redundant calculations, and it considers multiple test cases with varying input values for a flexible and scalable approach.
