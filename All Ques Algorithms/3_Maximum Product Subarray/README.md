The primary function, maxProduct, computes the maximum product of a contiguous subarray within a given array of integers.

Problem Statement: Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) that has the maximum product. The subarray can include both positive and negative numbers.

Key Idea: The core challenge in finding the maximum product of a subarray is that the product of negative numbers flips the sign of the result. To address this, the algorithm maintains two variables, max_prod and min_prod, at each step of the loop, which represent the maximum and minimum products for subarrays ending at the current index. These are initialized to the first element of the array.

Loop Through Array: The algorithm iterates through the given array nums from the second element to the end. For each element:
If the current number is negative, max_prod and min_prod are swapped because a negative number could transform a minimum product into a maximum product and vice versa.
max_prod is updated to be the maximum of either the current number or the product of max_prod with the current number. Similarly, min_prod is updated to be the minimum of either the current number or the product of min_prod with the current number.
The result is updated to be the maximum of result and max_prod.

Return Result: After processing all elements, the algorithm returns result, which holds the maximum product of any contiguous subarray in the given array.

Main Functionality:The program reads the size of the array n from an input file input3.txt.
If n is non-positive, it outputs an error message and exits.
Otherwise, it reads n elements into the vector nums.
Calls maxProduct(nums) to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray.
Outputs the result to an output file output3.txt along with explanatory text.
By using max_prod and min_prod, the algorithm effectively handles cases with negative numbers and maintains an optimal solution in linear time. This approach allows the algorithm to find the maximum product of a contiguous subarray while avoiding the issues caused by sign changes.
